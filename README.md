 Project: Recipes Foundations Course

This project is meant to demonstrate my so-far acquired skills when implementing HTML, using Git as a VCS, and github as my repository base for future
work.

This practice will ensure that my skills will develop further and that the streamline process of building and displaying work can thus become a part of 
memory and repetition.

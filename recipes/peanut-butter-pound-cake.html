    <h2><em>Description:</em></h2>

    <br>

    <p>Pound cake refers to a type of cake traditionally made with a pound of each of four ingredients: flour, butter, eggs,<br>
    and sugar. The traditional recipe makes a cake much larger than most families can consume, and so the quantity is often<br>
    changed to suit the size of the cake that is desired.</p>

    <br>

    <h3><em>Ingredients:</em></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups butter, softened</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅓ cup finely chopped peanuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><em>Steps:</em></h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan; line with parchment paper.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and creamy. Beat in eggs one at a<br>
        time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract. Beat in peanut butter slowly.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Mix into the butter mixture, a little at a time, until batter is<br>
        well blended. Pour batter into the prepared tube pan.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle peanuts on top. Reduce oven temperature to 325<br>
        degrees F (165 degrees C). Continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes<br>
        more.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Cool cake in the pan for 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

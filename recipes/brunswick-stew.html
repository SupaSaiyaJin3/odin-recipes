    <h2><em>Description:</em></h2>

    <br>

    <p>Brunswick stew is a tomato-based stew generally involving local beans, vegetables, and originally small game meat such<br>
    as squirrel or rabbit, though today often chicken. The exact origin of the stew is disputed. The states of Virginia,<br>
    North Carolina, and Georgia all claim its birth, with Brunswick County in Virginia and the city of Brunswick in Georgia<br>
    both claiming it was developed there. It may have originated earlier in some form in the city of Braunschweig (English:<br>
    Brunswick) in the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg in today's northern Germany.</p>

    <h3><em>Ingredients:</em></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces sliced bacon</li>
        <li>10 ounces thick-cut, bone-in, pork chop</li>
        <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups water, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen yellow corn, thawed</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups frozen lima beans, thawed</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen cut okra, thawed</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded, diced</li>
        <li>2 cups cubed russet potatoes (1/2-inch cubes)</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced green onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><em>Steps:</em></h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Add sliced bacon to a dry soup pot and cook on medium-high until browned and almost fully rendered. After bacon is about<br>
        halfway cooked, move it to the outside of the pot and set pork chop into the middle of the pot. Cook on each side until<br>
        lightly browned, about 2 minutes each. Remove pork chop and add chicken thighs, skin side down, and also brown on each<br>
        side. Browning is optional but it will add more flavor.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Once the bacon has cooked, add onions and salt. Cook and stir until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. If<br>
        the pot is getting too hot, lower heat to medium. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add diced<br>
        tomatoes, and stir to deglaze the bottom. Increase heat to high, bring to a simmer, and stir in garlic powder and black<br>
        pepper.</li>   

        <br>

        <li>Add browned pork chop and chicken thighs back to the pot, along with any accumulated juices and water. Bring to a simmer,<br>
        and reduce heat to medium-low, or low to maintain a steady but gentle simmer. Simmer until meat is very tender and falls<br>
        of the bone, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Remove meat from the pot and transfer to a bowl until cool enough to be handled. Separate the meat from the bone and<br>
        skin, and add it back to the pot.</li>

        <br>

        <li>Add corn, lima beans, okra, red pepper, and potatoes, and stir to combine. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Stir in<br>
        brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper. Let the pot come back to a simmer (you can raise heat to do this<br>
        faster, but reduce back to medium-low to maintain a simmer).</li>

        <br>

        <li>Simmer until potatoes are tender, and everything is cooked to your liking, about 30 minutes more. Add water or chicken<br>
        broth to the pot if it seems like things are getting too thick, but this is a stew, and should be fairly thick. Once<br>
        done, stir in vinegar. Taste, adjust salt, and serve with green onions.</li>
    </ol>
